Ch 20 - Input Devices
	Serial Ports
	COM Port Settings
	USB
	Firewire
	Keyboards
	Mice
	Scanners
	Cameras
	Other Devices

------------------------------------------
Serial Ports
	Low speed I/O port 		[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Serial_port.jpg]]
	Defined by RS-232 spec
	Makes use of UART to convert between serial and parallal
	9-pin male DB connector on PC
	May be used by external modems or UPS
		Internal modems have a serial port on the card
		Most UPSs now use USB
	Still used to connect to console port on routers
	Referred to as COM port in software

-------------------------------------------
COM port settings
	Two devices connected via a serial cable need to have the following settings configured the same way.
		bits per second 		[[img http://images.picotech.com/nport_properties.jpg]]
		data bits
		parity (odd/even)
		stop bits 
		flow control
	These can be set via the COM port properties page in the device manager

--------------------------------------------
USB 
	Originally intended to support low speed external devices and replace serial, parallel, and PS/2 ports
	Now supports both low and high speed devices 		
	Versions 										[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Usb_connectors.JPG]]
		1.1 - 1.5M, 12Mbps (lowspeed, fullspeed)	[[img http://photos.appleinsider.com/dual-bus-usb3-cables.jpg]]
		2.0 - 480 Mbps (highspeed)					
		3.0 - 5 GBps (superspeed)
		All are backwards compatible
	Connectors 		
		Computer - Type A, mini A, micro A
		Device - Type B, mini B (5 or 8 pin), micro B 
	With USB, you typically install the drivers BEFORE plugging in the device - RTM

-----------------------------------------------
USB Specs
		Max cable length: 		[[img images/usb-cable.jpg]]
			5 meters for 1.1 and 2.0
			3 meters for 3.0
		Max repeaters: 5 		[[img http://www.c-lab.org/fileadmin/user_upload/zubehoer_produkte/usb_repeater.jpg]]
		Max devices per controller: 127
		Max Power provided per port
			500ma for 2.0
			900ma for 3.0

------------------------------------------
Firewire
	Also known as IEEE1394 	[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/FireWire_cables.jpg/800px-FireWire_cables.jpg]]
	Supports high-speed external devices
	Used primarily by Apple
	Versions 				[[img http://www.cables.com/Merchant5/BVModules/Themes/CablesDotCom/images/Manufacturers/Datacomm/IEEE8009-9-2M.png]]
		1394a - 400 Mbps
		1394b - 800 Mbps
	Specs
		Max Cable Length: 4.5 meters
		Max devices: 63
------------------------------------------
Keyboards
	Connect via PS/2 or USB [[img http://www.unotron.com/us/images/prod/prod_s6000k_main.jpg]]
	Minor configuration can be done via Keyboard Control Panel Applet
		repeat delay
		repeat rate [[img http://s3.hubimg.com/u/2425774_f520.jpg]]
	If dirty, can be cleaned with rag and soapy water or isopropyl alchohol
	Disconnect before cleaning, make sure it's dry before reconnecting

------------------------------------------
Mice
	Connect via PS/2 or USB			[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/3-Tastenmaus_Microsoft.jpg/233px-3-Tastenmaus_Microsoft.jpg]]
	Configuration can be done via Mouse Control Panel Applet
	Two types						[[img http://www.logitech.com/assets/32954/3/logitech-wireless-trackball-m570.png]]
		Ball (obsolete)
		Optical
	Ball mice collect dirt on rollers.  
	Ball can be removed and rollers cleaned with almost any small, non-metalic, scraper
	Mouse substitutes: trackball, touchpad, etc..
------------------------------------------
Scanners
	Connect via PS/2 [[img http://cdn.ifanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/scanner.jpg]]
	Come with scanner software
	Use TWAIN drivers
	Optical resolution 
		measured in dpi (dots per inch)
		800-3000 dpi typical
	Color depth
		bits used to store each "pixel"
		24, 36, or 48-bit

-------------------------------------------
Cameras
	Digital cameras 	[[img http://www.english-online.at/news-articles/technology/sony-digital-camera.jpg]]
		used for taking photos
		Store photos on digital media
		Photos typically uploaded via USB
	Web Cams 	[[img http://www.holton.k12.ks.us/hhs/astronomy/elkcreekobservatory/images/webcam.jpg]]
		small "movie cameras" connect to computer
		Used for video conferencing
		Connect via USB

-------------------------------------------
Other devices
	Biometric Devices 	[[img http://www.payroll-software.in/images/Device.png]]
		Used for security
		Typically fingerprint readers
		Not yet reliable
	Bar Code readers	[[img http://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/barcode_reader.jpg]]
		Used to read UPCs on products
	Touch Screens
		Monitors with touch pad overlay which is used in place of a mouse
		Used in info kiosks, POS systems, tablet PCs
		Historically were relatively expensive, but price as has come down as production increased (due to use in tablets)
	[[KVM Switch!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch]]
		Allows multiple systems to share one Keyboard, mouse, and screen

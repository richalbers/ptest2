Ch 31 - PC and Component Selection
	This presentation covers
		The different purposes a PC may serve
		How to choose components when building a PC from parts
------------------------------------------
Business Computers (as per CompTIA)
	Standard Desktop (ie. Workstation) 
		Meets recommended requirements for running Windows
		Can run multiple apps at the same time
		CompTIA calls this a "thick client"
	Thin Client
		Meets minimum requirements for running Windows
		Sufficient to run one app at a time
		Likely used for special purposes, such as a Point of Sale machine
	Virtualization Workstation
		Used to run Virtual Machines
		Requires lots of RAM and decent CPU
	Media Workstation
		Used for editing video or 3-D modelling
		Requires lots of RAM and Disk space, and good video card
--------------------------------------------
Specialized Consumer PCs
	Home Server
		Provides Centralized Storage space
		Provides Media Streaming, File Sharing, Printing
		Microsoft sells a version of Windows for this (Home Server)
		A NAS (network attached Storage) box might also suffice.
	Home Theater PC
		Enables you to play music, watch TV and movies
		Connected to TV (or projector) and surround sound speakers	
		Microsoft provides software for this (Media Center)
		There are also 3rd party versions (XBMC or Plex)
	Gaming Machine
		Runs latest video games well
		A high-end machine; good graphics card is essential
-----------------------------------------
Picking components
	Components are chosen based on purpose of system
		Keep in mind the projected lifespan of the system.  Will it still be usable in X number of years?
		Some things are easier to upgrade (memory) than others (CPU)
	Read customer reviews to judge quality of choices
	Some places sell "bare-bones" systems that include a case, Power Supply, Motherboard and CPU.
	CPU and motherboard are typically chosen first; make sure all subsequent component selections work with the chosen motherboard.

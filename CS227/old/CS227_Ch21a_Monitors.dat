------------------------------------------
Common Monitor Properties
	Size 			[[img http://birnamwoodgames.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Aspect-Ratios.png]]
		Diagonal measure, in inches
		15, 17, 19, 22, 24, etc..
	Aspect Ratio
		Regular - 4:3
		Widescreen - 16:9 	[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Vector_Video_Standards4.svg/1000px-Vector_Video_Standards4.svg.png]]
	Resolution 
		Horizontal X Vertical Pixels
		Higher resolutions make things smaller on screen

--------------------------------------------
Properties continued...
	Refresh Rate	[[img http://www.hauppauge.com/pics/HDPVR2_PC_setup_3.png]]
		How often image is drawn
	Somewhat different between CRTs and LCDs
	Very important for CRTs (Vertical or VRR)
		Too low causes eye strain
		Too high can damage display
		Higher is better, under 72 Hz is bad (with CRTs)
	Set via display properties
	
------------------------------------------
CRTs (Obsolete)
	Make use of a really big vacuum tube [[img http://www.unc.edu/~driedell/crt.jpg]]
	Draw image using three electron guns, one for Red, Green, and Blue
	High-voltage coils "bend" the beams to cause them to scan across the screen [[img http://cs.fit.edu/~wds/classes/cse5255/thesis/images/crt.gif]]
		May contain high voltage (15KV+) even when off and unplugged
		Do not disassemble or attempt to repair them
	Typically have a slight curve to the screen, causes reflections [[img http://www.worldofpwnage.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/crt_vs_lcd_b.jpg]]
	Later ones came with "flat" fronts, referred to as flat-screens 
		Oftentimes confused with LCDs, which are flat panels]]

---------------------------------------------
CRT Advantages and Disadvantages
	Advantages
		Great picture at all resolutions
		Fast Response Times
		Inexpensive
	Disadvantages
		Bulky (big and heavy)
		Inefficient (electricity -> heat)
		Emit possibly harmful radiation

-------------------------------------------
CRT Properties
	Dot Pitch 		[[img http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/display4.gif]]
		Distance between phosphorous dots of same color
	Resolution 		 [[img http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/monitor-crt-diagonal.jpg]]
		Actually less then specified.
		19" was actually about 17.5"

-------------------------------------------
LCDs
	Creates picture using:  [[img images/Backlights.jpg]]
		backlight (and diffuser) [[img http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/me7iMc7tRyBDl5wzvgiArRg.jpg]]
			CCFL, require high AC voltage, provided by inverter
			LED, lower power, thinner, brighter
		Liquid Crystal - blocks Red, Green, or Blue light)
	Two LCD technologies [[img http://www.lecerveau.org/images/02-7hh_illo2b.gif]]
		Passive Matix
			Older technology
			Improved via Dual-Scan Passive Matrix
			Now found only on low-end monitors
		Active Matrix (or TFT)
			More expensive
			Provides faster, crisper image

-------------------------------------------
LCD Advantages and Disadvantages
	Advantages (vs CRTs)
		Thinner and Lighter
		Lower Power Consumption
		Flicker Free
		Longer life
	Disadvantages (vs CRTs)
		Only look great at native resolution

--------------------------------------------
LCD Properties
	Native Resolution		[[img http://img.bhs4.com/cf/d/cfd7bde7975bc19292f55e45429bfd88decc326f_large.jpg]]
		The actual number of pixels on the screen
	Refresh Rate
		How often images are redrawn
			Measured in HZ
		60Hz was standard for a long time (16ms)
		120Hz (or faster) are now available.
		Does it matter?  [[Depends on the person/application!http://www.maximumpc.com/refresh_rate_2013?page=0,1]].
	Response Rate
		Time it takes to change a pixel from white to black
		Low response rates don't display fast-moving images well
		Old LCDs had response rates of 20+ms
		8 ms or less is good (Some are now <= 2ms)
			Note: different color trasitions take different amounts of times, and there's no designated test to determine a response rate, so manufactures typcially choose a value that makes their specs look as good as possible.
--------------------------------------------
LCD Properties continued...
	Brightness (of backlight)
		Measured in nits
	Contrast Ratio (static)
		Difference between black and white
		Range from 250:1 and 1000:1
	Contrast Ratio (Dynamic)
		Achieves higher numbers by dimming the backlight
		Don't compare dynamic to static ratios!

------------------------------------------
Monitor Connections
	VGA (RGB, DSub-15)  [[img images/VgaHdmiDvi.jpg]]
		15 pins, in three rows
		Analog signal (Optimal for CRTs)
	DVI (Digital Video Interface) [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/DVI_Connector_Types.svg/500px-DVI_Connector_Types.svg.png]]
		Several Flavors
			DVI-A - analog
			DVI-D - digital
			DVI-I - integrated (both)
		DVI-I and D
			Single link - lower resolutions
			Dual Link - higher resolutions
	HDMI - High Definition Multimedia Interface
		Basically, Single-link DVI + audio
	DisplayPort
		Higher Resolution support
--------------------------------------------
Projectors
	Front View 		[[img http://www8.pcmag.com/media/images/304748-canon-realis-sx80-mark-ii.jpg?thumb=y]]
	Typically use an 
		LCD
		Lamp (a Very bright backlight)
	Lamp generates lots of heat
	Throw Distance - projector to screen [[img http://htrgroup.com/images/doc_minmax_throwdistance.gif]]
	Throw Ratio - throw/screen width 
--------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
	Adjustments are available for contrast/brightness/color
	If one color goes out check cable for bent pin
	CRTs
		Degause button can remove big color splothes
		CRTs should NOT be opened up by techs
	LCDs
		Inverter or backlight failure are most common problems
			image will be visible with bright flashlight pointed at screen 
		Both can sometimes be replaced, but may not be cost effective

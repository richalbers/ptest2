Form Factor
	Form factor defines 	[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Motherboards_form_factors.svg/719px-Motherboards_form_factors.svg.png]]
		the size of the motherboard
		general location of components and ports
	Form Factors 	
		Obsolete		[[img http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115420/Cyber-club%20800x600/Gif/pics/PC%20Tech%20Guide/MB%20NLX.gif]]
			AT - The Original!
			LPX & NLX - slimline
			BTX - designed to address P4 heat issues, but was shortlived
		Current		[[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/VIA_Mini-ITX_Form_Factor_Comparison.jpg]]
			ATX - Old, but still most common
				Standard, Micro, Flex
			ITX - Small Form Factor (SFF)
				Mini, Nano, pico

-----------------------------------
Chipset Evolution
	Northbridge 									[[img http://media.bestofmicro.com/K/S/116092/original/P35_Block_Diagram.jpg]]
		Originally was mostly a memory controller	[[img http://techreport.com/r.x/core-i7/system-block-diagram.gif]]
		Then high speed I/O was added to it			[[img http://zapp5.staticworld.net/images/article/2011/11/x79_blockdiagram-5236050.jpg]]
		Then memory controller was moved to CPU		[[img http://techreport.com/r.x/llano-mobos/block.jpg]]
	Southbridge
		Low speed I/O hub
		Originally connected to northbridge
		Now directly connected to CPU (because northbridge is gone!)
			And now sometimes called the northbridge...
	Block diagrams on the right show the evolution of the chipsets
		Intel
			Core 2
			First Generation i7
			Second Generation i7
		AMD
			APU (Accelerated Processing Unit)
				APUs a marketing term for a combined CPU/GPU 
---------------------------------------
Expansion Busses/Slots
	Expansion busses/slots allow you to "expand" the capabilities of your computer
	Current Common Ones			
		PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect [[img images/PCI_Keying.png]]
			General purpose, been around a long time
			3.3v (uncommon), 5.0v (common), or Universal
		PCIe - PCI Express  [[img http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/operab/2010-07-08_021703_PCI_PCIe_Slots.jpg]]
			Newest expansion bus - general purpose
			Works in software like PCI, but hardware is completely different
			Utilizes from 1 to 32 "lanes"
---------------------------------------
Expansion Busses/Slots Continued
	Obsolete 		[[img http://www.csepedia.com/Images/Peripherals/AGP_PCA_ISA.jpg]]
		ISA - Industry Standard Architecture
			Original expansion slot.  
		AGP - Accelerated Graphics port
			Only used for video 
	Others 		[[img images/pci-slots.jpg]]
		[[PCI-X!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-X]] - PCI extended 
			64-bit PCI bus used in high-end workstations and servers
		Mini-PCI
			Laptop PCI form factor
-----------------------------------
Onboard Components
	As motherboards evolved, they've included components that used to be available only with expansion cards [[img images/MB_Ports3.jpg]]
	Examples:				 [[img images/MB_Ports2.jpg]]
		USB/Firewire
			Ports on back
			Connections to ports on case
		Sound 				[[img images/MB_Ports.jpg]]
		Video
		Modems
		NIC (Network Interface Cards)
	Drivers for on-board components are obtained from the motherbaord manufacturer
		Optical media (shipped with motherboard)
		Website - for up-to-date drivers

	Summary
---------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
	Review the lab sheet so you know what you'll be doing
		We'll do this as a group
	Clear space off the table in front of you
	After the review and questions have been answered...
		Get the equipment specified on the lab sheet (carry it with care)
			One person gets the PC, the other the keyboard/mouse
			Ask if something's missing that you think you need
			Verify you're using the correct PC from the correct set
				Instructor will inform you which set is being used
				PC number should match your table number
	Start working, with your team member
---------------------------------------------------
During the Lab
	Take proper static precautions at all times
	Don't screw in the VGA cables
	Screens are dual display, push button to select VGA.  When done, put it back!
	Work together - everyone works on all parts
		All team members need to understand all that is done
			Don't "Divide and conquer".  This might be a good strategy to get projects done, if that's the sole goal, but it's not a good strategy in education when the goal is to get experience with everything being done.  
	Ask questions if something's unclear
	Feel free to help nearby groups if the need it
	Always remember: The goal is to learn, not get done as fast as possible

---------------------------------------------------
Finishing Up
	Verify instructor has noted you've completed the lab
	Put all equipment away
		Be careful when putting PCs away so as to not knock off feet	
	Make sure Monitor setting is NOT on VGA
	Clean up your workspace so it's ready for the next class
----------------------------------------------------

	Work safely (protect yourself and equipment)
	Work together - everyone works on all parts
		Remember: The goal is to learn, not get done as fast as possible
	Be careful when putting PCs away so as to not knock off feet

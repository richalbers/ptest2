Overview
	Storage Mechanism [[img images/Drives.jpg]]
		Traditional HDD - Magnetic Platters 
		Solid State Drive - Flash memory
	Bus (data connnection) 
		IDE (not sometimes called Parallel ATA)
		Serial ATA
		SCSI (typically only on Servers)
		Fiber Channel (typically only on Servers)
------------------------------------------
Magnetic Platter Drives
	Drives Geometry consists of [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg/360px-Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg.png]]
		Heads (platters * 2)
		Cylinders (tracks)
		Sectors
	ZBR ([[Zone Bit Recording!http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/tracksZBR-c.html]]) makes number of sectors not the same for all cylinders [[img images/zbr.jpg ]]
	LBA - Logical Block Addressing [[img http://www.pcstats.com/articleimages/201201/seagate3TBxt_LBA2.jpg]]
	Spindle Speeds
		5400
		7200
		10000
		15000
-------------------------------------------
Solid State Drives
	Have no moving parts [[img images/SSD.jpg]]
	Use Flash memory to store data
	Noiseless
	Much Faster than traditional HDDs
	More Expensive than traditional HDDs
	Types of NAND
		MLC - Multi-level cell
			Slower, but less expensive
		SLC - Single-level cell
			Faster, but more Expensive
	Lifespan is determined by maximum# read operations per cell
		When it reaches EOL, you'll still be able to read it
-------------------------------------------
Common Terms	
	IDE - Integrated Drive Electronics
	ATA - Advanced Technology Attachment
	EIDE - Enhanced IDE
	SATA - Serial ATA
	PATA - Parallel ATA
		This term came about when SATA was invented
		The terms PATA, IDE, and EIDE, are often times used interchangeably
-------------------------------------------
ATA History / Versions
	ATA-1 (IDE)
		Supported 2 drives
		Utilized CHS
		Supports drives up to 504 MB
	ATA-2 (EIDE/ATAPI) 
		Utilized LBA 
		Supports drives up to 8.4 GB
		Supported optical drives
		Supported 4 drives

--------------------------------------------
ATA History continued
	ATA-3 - Introduced [[S.M.A.R.T.!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.]]
	ATA-4 - faster [[img images/PataCable.jpg]]
	ATA-5 - 66 MBps (ATA/66)
		needed 80 wire cable
	ATA-6 - 100 MBps (ATA/100)
		allowed drives > 128 GB
	ATA-7 - introduced SATA

--------------------------------------------
PATA overview 
	Utilizes 40 or 80 wire cable [[img images/PATA_Cable.png]]
	Motherboard may have two interfaces (channels) [[img images/PATA_Cable2.jpg]]
		Primary
		Secondary
	Each interface supports two drives
		Master
		Slave
	Setting the drive to "CS" allowed would cause it to be configured as either Master or Slave depending on it's position on the Cable (assuming it was a Cable Select cable)
--------------------------------------------
SATA overview
	Utilizes thin data cable [[img http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2005/11/23/pc_interfaces_101/hdd_sata_connected2.jpg]]
	Potentially Hot-swappable
	Much faster than PATA
	Versions
		Note: all speeds are given in bits, not Bytes.  And 1.5Gb/s was roughly equivalent to 150 MB/s of actual data transfer once overhead was accounted for.  Same applies to other speeds.
		SATA I (revision 1.x) - 1.5 Gb/s (150 MB/s) [[img http://www.addonics.com/faq/images/aasa2sa100c.gif]]
		SATA II (revision 2.x) - 3 Gb/s (300 MB/s)
		SATA III (revision 3.x) - 6 Gb/s (600 MB/s) 
		eSATA - external SATA
---------------------------------------------
AHCI
	BIOS can support SATA drives typically in three modes
		Parallal ATA Emulation (may be called compatibility mode)
		AHCI - [[Advanced Host Controller Interface!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHCI]]
		RAID - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
	AHCI 
		is configured in BIOS
		supported in Vista/7
		necessary if hot-swappablility is to be implemented

-------------------------------------------
SCSI (scuzzy)
	Small Computer Systems Interface
	Commonly used on Servers to support large numbers of drives
	Supports 8 or 16 devices on one bus
	Devices are identified by a SCSI ID, oftentimes set using dip switches
	Ends of the bus need Termination
	There are numerous versions, types of cables, connectors, and terminators.
-------------------------------------------
RAID
	Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks [[img images/raid0.png]]
	RAID 0 - Striping 
		Requires 2+ drives
	RAID 1 - Mirroring/Duplexing 	[[img images/raid1.gif]]
		Requires 2 drives
	RAID 5 - Striping with parity 	[[img images/raid5.png]]
		Requires 3+ drives
	RAID 6 - Striping with extra parity
		Requires 5+ drives
	RAID 10 (1+0) Striping and mirroring

Ch 8 - BIOS and CMOS
	Components on Motherboard
	Terms: Hardware/Software/Firmware
	BIOS
	EFI/UEFI
	CMOS
	BIOS/CMOS Setup screens
	Misc
-----------------------------------
Components on Motherboard
	Chipset
		Northbridge/Southbridge
	BIOS - Basic I/O System
	CMOS - Configuration settings
	Battery - keeps CMOS alive when not plugged it 

-----------------------------------
Hardware/Software /Firmware
	Hardware - Stuff you can touch
	Software - 
		Instructions for processor
		Typically stored in volatile memory
		Usually high-level, farily large 
	Firmware
		Very low-level code
		Simple programs stored in less-volatile media
		Often ROM or EEPROM

---------------------------------------
BIOS
	Stores 
		low-level I/O code (programs)
		Bootstrap code
	non-volatile (remembers without power)
	Usually on EEPROM
		Can be changed by "flashing"
	Separate chip on motherboard
	Major BIOS manufacturers
		AMI
		Award (/Phoenix)
	Old technology - being replaced by EFI/UEFI
-----------------------------------
EFI/UEFI
	(Unified) Extensible Firmware Interface
	Direct replacement for BIOS; allows more functionality
	Runs in 32 or 64 bit mode (BIOS runs in 16 bit mode)
	Necessary to boot off drives larger than 2.2TB
	Usually has fancy GUI setup screens
	Linus Torvalds thinks poorly of it
		"Not that I'd ever claim that the BIOS is wonderful either, but at least everybody knows that the BIOS is just a bootloader, and doesn't try to make it anything else."
	[[Wikipedia has lots more info if you're interested!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface]]
-----------------------------------
CMOS
	Often on Southbridge
	Stores configuration settings 
	Modified via CMOS Setup
	Volatile - requires power to remember
		That's why there's a battery on the motherboard
------------------------------------
BIOS/CMOS setup
	To get to setup screens	Press ESC or some funtion key. 
		Which key to press will be displayed on the screen during the boot process.
	Can typically be password protected
		If password is forgotten, there's usually a jumper that can clear it (it disconnects the battery); Consult the manual
		Note: avoid removing the battery; the holder is fragile
	Changes can make system faster, slower, or unable to boot
		Default settings can be loaded if unwanted changes are made
		If it's so messed up it won't boot even far enough to get to the Setup Screens, clear the CMOS via hardware as per the manual	
--------------------------------------
Misc
	POST - Power on Self Test
	Beep Codes
		Communicate info during POST before video is ready

	Drivers
		Software OS uses to communicate with hardware

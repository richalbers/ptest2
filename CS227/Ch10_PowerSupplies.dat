---------------------------------------------------
Safety
	Treat electricity with respect 	[[img images/Zapped.jpg]]
		Don't disassemble devices that can store electricity
		Use extreme caution when working with high voltage
		Common phrase is "Current Kills"
	Not all fire extinguishers can be used on Electrical equipment! 
		Fire Extinguisher classes		[[img http://img2.timeinc.net/toh/i/a/tools/fire-extinguishers-2-01.jpg]]
			Class A - Wood, Paper, etc..
			Class B - Flamable liquids
			Class C - Live electrical equipment
			Class D - Combustable metals
			Most common is ABC
---------------------------------------------------
Basics
	Electricity is the movement of electrons  [[img http://inspectapedia.com/electric/0501s.jpg]]
	Volts, Ohms, Amps, Watts [[img images/volt_amp_ohms.jpg]]
		Volts - How much force is being used to move electrons 
		Ohms - How much resistance a material has to their movement
		Amps - How many electrons are actually being moved
		Watts - Amount of power being used (Volts x Amps)
	AC vs DC  [[img http://www.techdose.com/tutorials/Repairing-an-Electrical-Plug-With-Ground-Pin-Cut-Off/370/images/outlet.jpg]]
		AC - Alternating Current
			Used to deliver power to your house
		DC - Direct Current
			Used by electronic devices
		Rectifier converts from AC to DC
	Outlet prongs			
---------------------------------------------------
Electrical Testing Tools
	Multimeter [[img images/Multimeter.jpg]]
		Multimeters can measure Voltage, Current, or Reistance
		For troubleshooing, they're used to measure voltage
	Power supply tester [[img images/PowerSupplyTester.jpg]]
		ATX power supplies need to recieve the proper signals to turn on, a power supply tester is the easiest way to accomplish this
	Outlet tester [[img images/OutletTester.jpg]]
		Outlets can be easily tested using an outlet tester
	For all tools, read the instructions before using
---------------------------------------------------
Power Equipment
	Surge Suppressors [[img images/PowerStrip.jpg]]
		Protect your equipment from voltage spikes
		Oftentimes built into power strips
	Power Conditioner
		Clean up all the noise on the power line
	UPS - Uninterruptable Power Supply [[img images/UPSSmall.jpg]]
		Provide temporary power in the event of a power failure
			Typically only 5-20 minutes of power, long enough for a backup generator to start or the system to shut down
		Also include surge suppression and power conditioning
		Use a power-calculator or on-line selection tools to determine the proper size
			Companies that sell UPSs typically provide such tools (e.g. www.apc.com)
---------------------------------------------------
Power Supply Connectors
	P1 - Main connector to motherboard [[img images/PowerConnectors.jpg]]
		20 or 24 pins
	P4 - Additional power for motherboard
		Needed for Pentium 4 CPUs (hence the name)
	Molex - Disk Drives 
		4 pin, rectangular
	SATA - Newer SATA disk drives
	Berg or Mini-Molox - Floppy drives
		4 pin
	PCIe Connectors
		6 or 8 pin
		Primarily for video cards
---------------------------------------------------
Soft Power Feature
	All ATX power supplies use soft power [[img images/ATX_PS_signals.png]]
		Power supply doesn't have on/off switch, power supply is turned on/off by the motherboard via two of the wires in the P1 connector
			These are usually labeled PS-ON and PWR-GOOD (or PWR_OK) in diagrams
	When user presses power button on Case, the following occurs
		Motherboard pulls PS-ON, which is normally 5v, to 0v
		Power Supply then starts providing power on all power lines, and when they have reached their correct voltages, it brings PWR-GOOD to 5v.
		Motherboard then starts boot process

---------------------------------------------------
Early Power Supply Versions
	AT (obsolete)	[[img images/PowerSupplyAT.jpg]]
		Molex, Berg, P8 &amp; P9
		Big 115v power switch
	ATX 
		P1 replaced P8 &amp; P9
		Soft Power feature replaced big switch
	ATX12v 1.0
		added P4 connector (for Pentium 4)
		added 6-pin AUX connector (never used)
		slightly increased power on 12v rails
----------------------------------------------------
ATX 2.x versions
	ATX12V 2.0 [[img images/PowerSupplyATX.jpg]]
		6-pin aux was removed
		P1 became 24 pins
			Extra 12v, 5v, 3.3v, and ground wires added
		added Serial ATA connectors
		reduced power on 3.3 &amp; 5v rails
		increased power on 12v rails
	ATX12V 2.1 [[img images/pcie6.jpg]]
		Added 6pin PCIe connector
	ATX 12V 2.2 [[img images/pcie8.jpg]]
		Added 8pin PCIe connector
	ATX 12V 2.3
		Increased efficiency (70% min, 80% recommended)
---------------------------------------------------
ATX Wire Colors
	Wire colors indicate voltages [[img images/ATX_ConnectorRef.png]]
		Orange: 3.3v
		Red: 5v
		Yellow: 12v
		Blue -12v
		Purple 5v (standby)
	Signal wires
		Green: PS_ON
		Gray: PWR_ON
		
---------------------------------------------------
Misc
	Rails [[img images/ATX_Rails.png]]
		12v lines are current-limited to approximately 18A total
		Multiple rails provided multiple "groups" of 18A sources
		Many power supplies now just have one "higher than 18A" rail (and sometimes claim they have mulitple rails anyway!)
	Modular Power Supplies  [[img images/ATX_Modular.jpg]]
		You plug in the wires you want
		Eliminates extra wires hanging around inside Case

---------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
	Verify PS is getting power before replacing.  Check:
		Cord (plugged in at both ends)
		Outlet (providing power, circuit breaker not tripped)
		power switch on back of power supply (is on)
		115/230 switch on back of power supply (set to 115)
	Because of Soft power feature, a good power supply might not start up because of
		incorrectly wired power switch from case to motherboard
		defective/dead motherboard 
	Use Power supply tester to test PS without it hooked up to a computer
